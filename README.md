# Drug Recommendation System

This project is a machine learning-based drug recommendation system that predicts suitable drugs for patients based on their health conditions and attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

#Features
Predicts drug type using patient input

Built with machine learning (classification models)

Trained on a real-world dataset

User-friendly interface (optional: with Flask/Streamlit)

Customizable and extendable

#Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (ML Models)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)

Flask / Streamlit (optional frontend)
